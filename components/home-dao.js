              <h3>Mission</h3>
              <p>The PillarDAOâ€™s mission is to decentralize governance, explore and build worthy initiatives and fund Web3, multichain infrastructure and technology products. As advocates for the community, the PillarDAO is collectively run, member-owned and governs the Pillar Project Association. All profits from  DAO products (current & future) are routed directly into the DAO treasury. 
PillarDAO is to utilize the funds in the PillarDAO treasury to fund:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Worthy initiatives supporting DAO products.</li>
                <li>Marketing efforts for product distribution.</li>
                <li>Initiatives that upskill DAO members.</li>
                <li>Payment of contributors for their time and efforts.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Our DAO governance ensures a future where individuals collectively lead technological development rather than faceless corporations.</p>
